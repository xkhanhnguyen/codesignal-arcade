"""
Given a divisor and a bound, find the largest integer N such that:

N is divisible by divisor.
N is less than or equal to bound.
N is greater than 0.
It is guaranteed that such a number exists.

Example

For divisor = 3 and bound = 10, the output should be
solution(divisor, bound) = 9.

The largest integer divisible by 3 and not larger than 10 is 9.
